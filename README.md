# iL Low Pivot
Low Pivot for the Industrias Lorenzo Eurojoystick.
This replaces the stock pivot (part number C-03-021317) and allows for the shaft to be used in the low position without the actuator popping. 
Useful for when the stick is installed on thinner panels and you don't want the top to be so tall.
